backend file will contain all of the html files in the templates folder and the python backend when that gets developed

frontend file will contain all the react apps (still working on this)

index.html will be moved to templates later. For now it can stay in the root directory since it lets us see the website from GitHub.

TODO:
Add backend python files
Organize css and javascript files into static folder
Finish react apps
	Convert booklog and start reading page to react (since they both use pdf display)
	Bundle react apps and move them to static folder
